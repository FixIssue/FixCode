**Xcode 8 does not load unsigned code anymore** - see <https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz/issues/475>, therefore this project is deprecated and only available for historical purposes.

Fixing the <code>Fix Issue</code> button
</p>

This Xcode plugin disables the `Fix Issue` functionality in Xcode. This way, none of your team members can click this button by mistake and might end up revoking existing certificates and provisioning profiles.

# Installation

### Using fastlane

Add the `install_xcode_plugin` to your `Fastfile`. This way, the plugin gets installed for the whole team, so that no one can revoke your certificate by mistake.

```ruby
lane :xcode do
  install_xcode_plugin(github: 'https://github.com/neonichu/FixCode')
end
```

```
fastlane xcode
```

### Alcatraz
You can install `FixCode` using [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/). 

First, install [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/) using

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/deploy/Scripts/install.sh | sh
```

- Restart Xcode
- Click on `Window`
- Select `Package Manager`
- Search and Install `FixCode`
- Restart Xcode

# What does this do?

The primary goal of this plugin is to **disable** the original `Fix Issue` button, as it has side effects, like sometimes [revoking your certificates and with it all its provisioning profiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastlane/sigh/master/assets/SignErrors.png).

This is especially a big problem when working in a bigger team: Someone clicks the `Fix Issue` button and revokes the other profiles. This includes Enterprise profiles, resulting in breaking the app on all devices it's installed on.

This Xcode plugin will deactivate the button and replace it with emojis. The button will open the [official code signing guide](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/docs/CodeSigning.md).

You might ask yourself, why the button doesn't just run [sigh](https://github.com/fastlane/sigh) or [cert](https://github.com/fastlane/cert): Check out the [blog post about developer tools by Felix Krause](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-tools) for more information about how developer tools should be transparent and show you what they do.
